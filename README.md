# MediBuddy

**Recipient of the first-place prize at LA Hacks for the Patient Safety Technology Challenge**

## Inspiration

MediBuddy is inspired by the serious issue of medical errors in healthcare, which leads to approximately 250,000 deaths in the United States each year. Despite extensive training, healthcare professionals still make errors, resulting in incorrect treatment plans or the overlooking of major diseases. Leveraging machine learning models, MediBuddy analyzes symptoms, body measurements, and other inputs to provide accurate, personalized suggestions on diagnoses and treatments based on previous case data. The aim is to reduce misdiagnosis rates by utilizing a large database of medical history to produce accurate predictions, ultimately complementing the work of physicians.

## What it does

MediBuddy is a website powered by a machine learning disease prediction model aimed at solving the problem of diagnostic errors in healthcare. The machine learning model provides confident inferences about whether a patient likely has a certain condition given input from a healthcare professional, acting as a virtual physicianâ€™s assistant to help reinforce diagnoses and compile personalized reports of recommendations for patients. These inferences are then fed to Google's Gemini to generate a report that offers recommendations regarding diet, exercise, and other habits to treat or prevent specific conditions.

## How we built it

### Roles:

- **Choidorj Bayarkhuu:** Primary frontend developer (CS @ UCLA)
- **Arnav Roy:** Primary backend logic developer, front end, machine learning (CS @ UCLA)
- **Stanley Sha:** Backend developer and presentation contributor (CS @ UCI)
- **Emma Wu:** Data processing, frontend developer, Gemini Integration, and presentation lead (STATS + DS @ UCLA)

### Frontend:

The frontend of MediBuddy is mostly built using HTML, CSS, with some SCSS and JavaScript. Key components include:
- Landing page providing information about the site and navigation to other pages.
- Login page for user authentication.
- User input page for gathering patient data.
- Results page displaying machine learning predictions and customized reports.

### Backend:

MediBuddy's backend incorporates a K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning model and Gemini LLM via Flask and SQLite. Key components include:
- Training the machine learning model on previous diagnosis data.
- Using Flask to create an app for frontend-backend communication.
- Processing patient data and feeding results to the machine learning model.
- Integrating Google Gemini to generate custom AI reports.
